# Abstract

*Summary*: Biomedical ontologies define terms and related synonyms for observations represented in research data. When mapped to such terms, data become more interoperable and reusable. However, associating data with ontology terms is often a manual, time-intensive process. To address this problem, we developed Good Nomen, a user-friendly Web application that enables researchers to map variables and data values against ontologies, in an interactive manner, with full provenance.

*Availability and Implementation*: Good Nomen is available from http://bioapps.byu.edu/GoodNomen. Source code is available at https://github.com/srp33/GoodNomen.
%TODO: Make sure the URLs are valid and working.
%TODO: Explain on the GitHub site how to run it locally via Docker.

Historically, biomedical researchers often worked independently of each other, and findings were communicated in relatively small circles, which sometimes led to disparate naming conventions for research variables and non-standardized data values. Improved communication technologies and digitization of health records have enabled more data sharing among research groups[@adler-milsteinSharingClinicalData2012;@kayeDataSharingGenomics2009a]. In addition, biomedical data are now shared frequently in the public domain, with the hope that broader access to such data will lead to potential cures[@murphyServingEnterpriseInformatics2010;@pollardEICUCollaborativeResearch2018;@internationalcancergenomeconsortiumInternationalNetworkCancer2010a;@thecancergenomeatlasresearchnetworkComprehensiveGenomicCharacterization2008]. However, differences in naming conventions and terms used to describe data values have persisted, making it difficult to infer semantic meanings from data or to integrate disparate datasets[@bensonUsingSNOMEDHL72010;@kaufmanDataStandardizationPharmaceutical2016;@meyerDataCancerComparative2012;@zhangOntologyguidedSemanticData2018;@gonccalves2019variable]. Individual researchers and standards bodies have recognized this issue and are developing biomedical ontologies, which specify standardized terms and synonyms for biomedical concepts and states[@hartelModelingDescriptionLogic2005]. Unfortunately, these standards are not being used to annotate biomedical research data as universally as hoped[@bensonWhyInteroperabilityHard2010]. Although it is possible to annotate data manually or to write custom computer scripts to facilitate the mapping, these processes may be inefficient and lack reproducibility.

To facilitate standardization of We have developed Good Nomen, an interactive Web application that allows users to standardize clinical and molecular data using reference terminologies through a user-friendly interface. Our web application links to BioPortal (https://bioportal.bioontology.org/), which is a "comprehensive repository of biomedical ontologies." This app programmatically accesses many features of BioPortal; the recommender function recommends ontologies based on data uploaded, the automatch function matches terms in separate columns to their standardized value through the annotator function of BioPortal, and even new column names are recommended based on the data uploaded and ontologies in BioPortal. 
%TODO: more information about BioPortal / edit / ontologies

[comment]: <> (We currently support four publicly available terminologies, including recent editions of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Thesaurus[@sioutosNCIThesaurusSemantic2007]; the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM)[@centers2018international]; Medical Subject Headings[@rogersMedicalSubjectHeadings1963]; and the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee resource [@showsInternationalSystemHuman1979]. In addition, Good Nomen provide an option for users to upload other terminologies and apply those to data.
The specific use case we target is...
%Sample-level annotations are notorious for lack of uniformity across publicly available datasets, even within the same repository. )

Although Good Nomen supports using terminologies to standardize molecular data (such as HUGO for gene names), our descriptions in this paper focus on standardizing clinical data. We emphasize the scenario in which clinical data have been posted in public repositories, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Many researchers access these data, and data descriptors have sometimes been mapped to semantic identifiers. But...redundant columns, non-standardized data values...move some wording from the Data Example section up here?

# Methods

Good Nomen was built using the R-based Shiny framework[@rcoreteamrfoundationforstatisticalcomputingLanguageEnvironmentStatistical;@chang2018shiny]. To map a clinical data file to a standardized terminology, users walk through a series of steps described below.

*Load Data*: Good Nomen accepts clinical data files in comma-separated value (CSV), tab-separated value (TSV), and Excel formats. Each row in an uploaded file should represent a given patient; each column should represent a given clinical variable. After uploading a data file, users have an option to specify the number of header lines in the file; some files contain no header lines, while others contain one or more. Next the user select an ontology to use in the standardization process. The ontologies are programmatically downloaded from BioPortal and three ontologies are recommended based off of the data uploaded. If a user knows which ontology they want to use, they can type it into the dropdown menu and it will be selected. These ontologies are formatted with their acronym followed by their full name.

*Edit Data*: Data values can be standardized in two ways. The first method is an auto-matching process. After the user selects a column to standardize, Good Nomen uses the annotator tool found in BioPortal to match terms with their standardized term, based on the ontology selected. A table containing potential matches is displayed, and the user is asked to accept or reject each of the matches (Figure \ref{fig:AutoMatch}). When the user accepts a match, Good Nomen replaces each occurrence of the original value in the user's data with the preferred term from the terminology. Alternatively, users may standardize data values via manual matching. With this approach, Good Nomen displays a list of unique data values from the selected column. The user may select one or more of these terms to map to a preferred term. (Figure \ref{fig:ManualMatch}). Users may select this term, any term from the BioPortal ontology they selected, or a enter a new term to use as the standardized term. Good Nomen then replaces all instances of the data value with the preferred term. In addition, via manual matching, users can standardize missing values; the user indicates which data values represent missingness, and Good Nomen replaces each of these values with the characters "NA".

*Update Column Names*: Users may standardize the names of columns in their datasets based on the selected terminology. After users select a column to rename, Good Nomen uses BioPortal Recommender to recommend three standardized names for the column. If none of these recommendations are what the user wants, the user can type in their own new column name. 

*Save Data*: Users can export a standardized version of their data in CSV, TSV, or Excel formats. Good Nomen asks the user to enter a name for the output file. In addition to producing a standardized data file, Good Nomen generates an R script that contains the code necessary to reproduce the standardization process based on the user's selections while processing the data [@piccoloToolsTechniquesComputational2016a]. Users can download this script to save for future reference.

# Data Example

To test the effectiveness of our auto-matching approach, we analyzed treatment data from TCGA for 781 breast-cancer patients. This dataset contained 169 unique terms describing cancer therapies (Figure \ref{fig:BarChart1}). In many cases, multiple terms referred to the same drug treatment but were different variations on the generic drug name, referred to the drug's trade name, were misspelled, etc. For example, 13 different terms were used to describe *cyclophosphamide*, an alkylating agent commonly prescribed to breast-cancer patients. Using the NCI Thesaurus as a reference, Good Nomen's auto-matching feature identified matches for 95 of the 169 unique terms (Figure \ref{fig:BarChart2}). For cyclophosphamide, Good Nomen mapped 7 terms to the preferred term. The remaining terms were easily mappable through the manual-matching process. 

# Conclusions

Harnessing the power of reference terminologies into a user-friendly Web application will extend the reach and usefulness of these terminologies. Good Nomen enables researchers to standardize clinical and molecular terms more efficiently. Such standardization could provide greater consistency within a given dataset but also make it easier to combine data across studies.
%We hope that researchers who post datasets in the public domain to ensure greater consistency in how clinical and molecular terms are used.
